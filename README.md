This is a very simple Microsoft Windows 10 or later python script to disengage from use of computer.
The advantage of this script is that it does not access any registry files, no installation required. Your system is completely safe from any intrusion. 

To use the disengage script, download the two files in the DIST folder and save them on your system.
To make this truly effective:

Auto-Start disengage.exe with Windows (No Registry!)
a. Open the Startup Folder:

Press Windows + R → type shell:startup → press Enter.

This opens the user’s Startup folder.

b. Add your script:

Copy disengage.exe (and soothing.mp3) from the dist folder to this Startup folder.

Or (recommended): just create a shortcut to disengage.exe in this folder.

Your script will now auto-run every time you log into Windows.

DO NOT LIKE THIS?:
The repository is public. you can suggest the changes. or simple yet is remove the files from your system and you are GOLDEN.

!ENJOY coding and ENJOY Disengagement!
